Building CAB files...
ISDEV : error -6636: The file key gdiplus_dll_2_____X86.3643236F_FC70_11D3_A536_0090278A1BB8 and gdiplus_dll_2_____X86.3643236F_FC70_11D3_A536_0090278A1BB8 are found in the File table. Despite having different cases, the identical key names will cause an unexpected result when the files are installed on the target system. This occurs because the compressed files in the cabinet file are named using the file keys. To correct this issue, change one of the file keys to be unique in the cabinet file if you are building a compressed setup or a merge module. You can change the file key name in the Direct Editor view.
